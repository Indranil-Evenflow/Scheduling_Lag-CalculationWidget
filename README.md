Of course. A professional and concise README.md is essential for any project. It should be easy for both technical and non-technical users to understand the purpose of the tool, how to use it, and what to expect.

Here is a ready-to-use README file. Just copy and paste this into a README.md file in the root of your GitHub repository.

Pro-Tip: Before you commit this, take a screenshot of your running application and save it as dashboard_screenshot.png in an assets folder. This will make your repository look incredibly professional.

![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9+-blue.svg)

A web-based tool built with Streamlit to automatically analyze scheduling lag from raw data files, providing instant visualizations and downloadable reports. This application is designed to be used by non-technical teams, abstracting away all complex data processing.

Note: This is a representative screenshot. Your data will generate a unique view.

Core Features

Dynamic File Parsing: Intelligently handles .csv, tab-separated .csv, and .xlsx files.

Automatic Header Detection: Skips metadata and automatically finds the true header row in messy report exports.

Robust Data Cleaning: Handles common data issues like numbers formatted with commas (e.g., 109,874).

Automated Analysis: Instantly calculates:

Counts by schedule lag and category.

Running totals.

Cumulative percentages.

Interactive Dashboard: Displays key metrics and visualizes the "Within 1 Week" performance with an interactive chart.

One-Click Report Export: Allows users to download a fully formatted, multi-sheet Excel report with a single click.

Input Data Format

The application is designed to be robust. It expects a file containing three key columns, even if they are preceded by metadata.

scheduling_lag (or similar)

EvenFlow Flag (or similar)

Active Appointment (COUNT) (or similar)

The tool will automatically handle formats like this:
