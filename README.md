Key Features

Intuitive Web Interface: A clean, modern UI powered by Streamlit, designed for users with no programming experience.

Robust Data Ingestion:

Dynamic Header Detection: Automatically finds the table headers, even if they are preceded by metadata or empty rows.

Handles Messy CSV/TSV: Intelligently detects delimiters (comma vs. tab) and skips irrelevant preamble.

Data Cleaning: Automatically handles numbers with thousands separators (e.g., 109,874).

Automated Analysis: Generates key performance indicators, running totals, and cumulative percentages from the raw data.

Interactive Visualizations: Displays results in a clear, interactive bar chart created with Plotly Express.

One-Click Excel Reports: Produces a fully-formatted, multi-sheet Excel file with the complete analysis, ready for download.
